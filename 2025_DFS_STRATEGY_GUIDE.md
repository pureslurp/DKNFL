## Strategic Recommendations for 2025

### 1. Value-First Approach
**Priority:** Focus on value plays rather than just high scorers
- Use value ratio (points per $1000) as your primary metric
- Don't be afraid to roster lower-priced players with high value ratios
- Balance your lineup across different salary tiers

### 2. Quarterback Strategy
**Priority:** Leverage QB efficiency advantage
- QBs were the most efficient position in 2024
- Consider rostering multiple QBs in tournament lineups
- Pay attention to QB rushing upside for additional value

### 3. Stacking Strategy
**Priority:** Implement strategic stacking
- Target teams with high-value QB-WR/TE combinations
- Look for teams with multiple receiving options
- Consider game script and matchup factors
- Monitor teams that consistently provide stack value

### 4. Position-Specific Strategies

#### Quarterbacks
- **Target:** High-value QBs with rushing upside
- **Avoid:** Overpriced QBs with limited ceiling
- **Strategy:** Use QB as your lineup foundation

#### Running Backs
- **Target:** Workhorse backs with receiving upside
- **Avoid:** Committee backs with limited touches
- **Strategy:** Focus on volume and touchdown potential

#### Wide Receivers
- **Target:** WR1s in high-scoring offenses
- **Avoid:** WR3s in low-volume passing attacks
- **Strategy:** Stack with QBs when possible

#### Tight Ends
- **Target:** Primary receiving TEs in pass-heavy offenses
- **Avoid:** Blocking TEs with limited targets
- **Strategy:** Use as value plays in favorable matchups

### 5. Salary Management
**Priority:** Optimize salary allocation
- Premium tier ($8,000+) was most efficient in 2024
- Don't be afraid to pay up for proven performers
- Leave salary for value plays in other positions

### 6. Projection Accuracy
**Priority:** Understand projection limitations
- Overall projection accuracy was 2.71x actual (overestimated)
- QB projections were most accurate (0.95x actual)
- TE projections were least accurate (4.18x actual)

**Strategy:** 
- Be skeptical of TE projections
- Trust QB projections more
- Use projections as a guide, not gospel

### 7. Week-over-Week Monitoring
**Priority:** Track emerging trends
- Monitor position performance trends
- Identify teams with improving value
